              <h3>Senior Software Developer at Halter, Auckland - New Zealand</h3>
              <p>May 2019 — Dez 2020</p>
              <p>Halter is an Agritech startup company aiming to disrupt how dairy farms work by fitting a smart collar
                on
                cows. This smart collar can shift cows across the farm, or hold them to a specific area by using cues
                like
                vibration and sound while collecting important data that allows a deep understanding of cow behaviors.
                Using
                data science models it's possible to detect when a cow is grazing, sick, on heat, and more. With all of
                this
                Halter can reduce farming costs and optimize its efficiency.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a Senior Software Engineer, I'm responsible for:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Designing and implementing backend systems that are reliable, robust, and scalable. To achieve such
                  requirements, we leverage on event-driven, distributed microservices written in Java and Typescript
                  (Node.js).
                  We heavily rely on AWS managed services such as ECS, Kinesis, SNS, SQS, Lambda, Aurora, and DynamoDB
                  to
                  name
                  a few.

                  reliability, or simply catch and fix bugs.</li>
                <li>
                  Keeping a high bar on the quality of our codebase.
                  Given the high complexity nature of problems we are solving at Halter, I'm required to utilize
                  decision-making
                  and problem-solving skills, work with strong attention to details, and push for excellence, while
                  remaining
                  an

                  I had an important role in designing, implementing, and shipping
                  to production extremely critical systems like virtual fencing manager (break-fence-service), backend

              <h3>Software Development Specialist at iFood, Campinas, Sao Paulo - Brazil</h3>
              <p>November 2017 — April 2019</p>
              <p>iFood is the biggest food delivery app in Latin America, delivering around 20 million orders a month at
                that
                time. As a Software Development Specialist at Billing/Payout team, I was responsible for:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Design and implement scalable and highly reliable backend systems, able to process around 20 million
                  orders,
                  representing R$ 3B for 60k restaurants; and R$ 40M for around 80k drivers. Always important to notice
                  how
                  critical reliability is when dealing with this volume of money and the impact it can cause in people's
                  lives. To reliably attend to this volume, we built a set of Java, Spring Boot microservices, backed by
                  Postgres and Redis running on AWS EC2 instances. Simplicity is one key aspect we had in mind that's
                  worth
                  mentioning.

                  Maintain and prioritize both product and sprint backlog.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maintain a good relationship between the software development team
                  and client areas such as financial and customer support team.

              </ul>
              <p>
                In an incredibly fast-growing environment, as a leader, I was challenged to help the team to solve
                problems
                and deliver value with speed while keeping reliability intact given the high volume of money these
                systems
                processes.

                  I had a role as leader of D+7 Project. The goal of this project was to make the payout for online
                  orders
                  in
                  7 days after the transaction date, instead of fortnightly. The team was able to reinvent the way
                  financial
                  workflow and systems worked, to make daily payouts instead of twice a month. The final result was
                  beneficial
                  for iFood, which increased revenue with online orders by 2.5%, and for restaurants that saw a better
                  cash
                  flow. Also worth mentioning that the team was able to sell this product to over 10k restaurants with
                  no
                  sales team, only by using digital marketing. At iFood this was never done before and was noticed by
                  high
                  management.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I had a role as leader of the team that recreated the billing and payout systems in order to support
                  an
                  ever-growing demand and new regulations regarding financial operations in marketplaces like iFood.
                  This
                  was
                  a very complex, and also vital project where the team was challenged to meet an aggressive deadline to
                  deliver systems compliant with the new regulation otherwise iFood wouldn't be able to continue its
                  online
                  payment operation, which represents more than 60% of revenue.

              <h3>Software Development Manager at Synchro Solução Fiscal, Campinas, Sao Paulo - Brazil</h3>
              <p>February 2016 — December 2017</p>
              <p>
                Synchro is the biggest national provider of tax compliance systems with big multinational companies in
                its
                portfolio.
              </p>
              <p>From February 2016 until I left the company in December 2017, I took a role as manager of the platform
                development team. Even though the cloud environment is the way to go for many companies these days,
                there
                are
                still many companies unable or unwilling to make the move to the cloud. Especially when it comes to
                sensitive
                data such as accounting, financial transactions, and all tax-related data Synchro systems require as
                input.
                Because of that, development teams were required to support a variety of environments once each customer
                had
                a
                different set of applications and database server providers.
              </p>
              <p>In front of this, I envisioned a solution and was given the responsibility of leading a team to build a
                platform that would replicate a cloud environment on any on-premises server.
              </p>
              <p>To accomplish this, we packed a container scheduler into a Linux package and built a set of
                abstractions
                and
                managed services commonly used across all products, such as application configuration, message queue
                service,
                cache service, authentication service, batch processing service, data visualization, and more. With this
                platform as a base, product development teams could rely on well-defined interfaces and predictable
                runtime
                both on-premises and on Synchro's private cloud.
              </p>
              <p>This platform reduced development, maintenance, installation, and support costs, in addition to
                reducing
                customer cost with application and database servers license.

                At Panger I was the sole developer hired to migrate an ERP system from Clipper to Java. Over the course

            <p>As an affectionate listener of podcasts, I decided I need a better way
              of finding good podcasts to listen to. To solve this, I put together a podcast crawler to build a database

              and Elasticsearch. The recommendation engine is essentially a multilabel text classification algorithm
              implemented in Python, pandas, and scikit-learn.
