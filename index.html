					<p class="description">I joined Synchro as Software Developer working at a team that is responsible for developing a proprietary framework used by half of the company's projects. It was conceived before I joined the company and it is based on JSF and Hibernate. This set of components was formed by a GUI generator, user authentication, batch processing, automated tests facility and data audition. </p>
					<p>Shortly after I joined the team, we decided to create a new generation of this framework. Severeal of our new projects was being developed with the Grails platform, that was emerging at that time. So I was able to develop my skills, both technicaly and as a team leader, making decisions and conducting the team to getting this done. And then I became Software Architect.</p>

					<p class="description">Progonos was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_house" target="_blank">software house</a> that developed on demand software mainly for insurance companies. Here I worked as software developer in a project based on the <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Rich_Client_Platform" target="_blank">Eclipse RCP</a> platform. This project was really awesome. Based on the definition of a set of Entities (a meta model), it generated  at runtime all the functionality needed to interact with that business entity. That means the UI along with the code for the business logic. In short it was a highlevel platform for developing business software aimed at business analysts.</p>
					<p class="description">After that, I've worked on projects based on the Java EE platform. That means EJB 2.1, Hibernate ans Struts.</p>

					<p class="job-title first">Software Developer</p>
					<p class="description">At Porcelana Panger I was the sole programmer hired to migrate the software that ran the company, a small business ERP, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Clipper</a> to Java. The project took about 18 months and met the sponsor expectation. This was the very first Java project that I've worked on. Given the fact that at that time I was a PHP programer, the ability to teach myself was more than valuable. When the project was finished I've decided that was time for me to have a broader experience and work together with a full development team in larger projects. </p>

					<p class="description">This is where everything began. At the age of 16 I thought myself how to code in PHP using MySQL as database. Then I started to develop websites using LAMP stack for local business at my home town. The need of teaching myself technologies such as SQL, PHP, Javascript, CSS and HTML turn out to be a fundamental skill. After that I was able to learn everything that showed up. Given the speed of changes in the software development business, the ability to teach yourself is a matter of survival.</p>
